ReadMe - Tangram Eiffel Tower

On my honor, I have neither given nor received any aid on this assignment.

In this project, the tangram shapes were made geometrically and then moved around on the canvas.
The frame rate was reduced since 60fps was simply too fast and gave the viewer a headache from 
looking at it. The colors were created by using a random generator to get the first time the color 
was used in the sequence. After that, it was moved into the next variable so that the color appears 
to move down the tower.
