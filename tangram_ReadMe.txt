ReadMe -- tangrams

On my honor, I have neither given nor received any aid on this assignment.

The canvas is set to 616x800 for this project. The first several lines of code 
create the tangram pieces using simple shapes. The next lines use the parameters of the mouse to 
determine if it is within the shape and if the mouse is in the shape, the shape grows and turns purple.
When the size changes, the dimensions change by 20 with respect to the directions they move in geometrically.

I would like to thank Nicole Johnson for helping with the algorithm for detecting the mouse and helping with 
the math for calculating whether the triangles are correct or not.
