Project: Self Portrait

On my honor, I have neither given nor received any aid on this assignment.

In this project, a self portrait is drawn using basic shapes.
If the mouse rolls over the eyebrows, the bezier curve moves up
and if the mouse goes over the mouth, the mouth changes shape
as well. This is done using if statements that draw one obejct if the mouse is not over
the area and the other if it is.
