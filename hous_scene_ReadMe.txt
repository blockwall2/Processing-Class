ReadMe -- houseScene

On my honor, I have neither given nor received any aid on this assignment.

The size for the house is 1000x700. The clouds are controlled by using a 
variable x that changes by 1 every time the draw loop occurs. The ground is 
created by drawing an ellipse that spans the entire ground so that it is curved.
The house and tree are drawn using basic geometry and placed using the sketch made
during the first part of the first week of the semester.
